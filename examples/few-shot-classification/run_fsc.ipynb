interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture .', 'for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2\\xa01\\\\/2 - hour running time .', 'a devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism .', 'feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .', \"it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there 's a little girl-on-girl action .\", \"while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it 's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .\", 'a loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .', 'every now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be .', \"and it 's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting .\", 'why spend $ 9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ?', \"first and foremost ... the reason to go see `` blue crush '' is the phenomenal , water-born cinematography by david hennings .\", 'the story gives ample opportunity for large-scale action and suspense , which director shekhar kapur supplies with tremendous skill .', 'stevens has a flair for dialogue comedy , the film operates nicely off the element of surprise , and the large cast is solid .', \"( washington 's ) strong hand , keen eye , sweet spirit and good taste are reflected in almost every scene .\", 'sensual , funny and , in the end , very touching .', \"the film is a hoot , and is just as good , if not better than much of what 's on saturday morning tv especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all ca n't stand .\", \"ms. hutchins is talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about zelda 's ultimate fate .\", 'an admirable , sometimes exceptional film', 'this comic gem is as delightful as it is derivative .', \"others , more attuned to the anarchist maxim that ` the urge to destroy is also a creative urge ' , or more willing to see with their own eyes , will find morrison 's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating .\", 'moving and vibrant .', '( reynolds ) takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors and uses a magnificent landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch .', \"brian tufano 's handsome widescreen photography and paul grabowsky 's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special .\", 'a truly wonderful tale combined with stunning animation .', 'the most wondrous love story in years , it is a great film .', 'about schmidt is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year .', \"another love story in 2002 's remarkable procession of sweeping pictures that have reinvigorated the romance genre .\"]\n",
